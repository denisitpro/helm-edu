This is a test Helm chart for learning how to write and publish it online.
The chart consists of a test application written in Go, as well as a proxy service ({{ include "go-app.fullname" . }}-proxy) for the nginx ingress, which proxies traffic from the nginx-ingress namespace to the service of our test application.
